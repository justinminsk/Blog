Creating histograms using ggplots.

load libraries:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

Sort the data using dplyr:

```{r}
df<-Master%>%
  filter(!is.na(weight))%>%
  select(weight)

#get the weights form master of lahman
```

Graph the data:

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = df, aes(x = weight), color = "white", fill = "blue", bins = 25) +
  ggtitle("Baseball Player Weights")

#graph the weights in a histogram
```
